Setup
Get a YouTube Data API key
You need to create an API key to access the YouTube Data API. Follow the instructions on Google Developer Console to generate one.

Run the Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook file and replace the placeholder API key with your own:


API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
Input the YouTube Video URL
After setting up the API, input the URL of the YouTube video from which you want to fetch comments. The notebook automatically extracts the video ID and channel ID of the uploader.

Fetch and Filter Comments
The script fetches the comments in batches and excludes comments from the uploader. It also supports filtering comments that contain only emojis.

Sentiment Analysis
The comments are analyzed using the VADER sentiment analysis tool, which classifies each comment into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment categories.

Visualization
Finally, the results are visualized using matplotlib, showing the distribution of sentiment across the collected comments.

Example Output
The notebook prints the top 5 fetched comments and displays a plot that illustrates the sentiment analysis distribution.

Notes
The number of comments fetched can be adjusted in the code by modifying the limit in the while loop.
Ensure you handle API quotas and limits imposed by YouTube's API.
